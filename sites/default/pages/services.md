# From planning to operation

Do you need a new website, a webshop or an app? Does your server system need an update or a data security check?

My services cover the entire spectrum from planning and production to the operation of your website.

`Conception => Production => Maintenance`

## Planning and design

Planning is essential. The concept and the definition of the general conditions influence all your future interaction
with the website or app.

Complexity is the enemy of security and also the enemy of users and editors. Therefore we look for the simplest
system for the respective requirements.

A clear structure makes it easier to use. This is reflected in my design, the user interface of the app and the overall
concept of the website.

## Production

I draw on over 15 years of experience in developing apps and websites. What I program is tested and
works. Related to the technique, I offer

- full stack programming for web and apps,
- quality assurance and automated tests of webapps and shops, unit tests, tests automation.

## Operation and maintenance

In order for your website or app to run stable, it is necessary to regularly update the system. Data loss can be
counteracted with a backup concept. With a maintenance contract I can offer you a carefree flatrate for a functional
server system that runs stable and always has all important security updates installed.
