# Data privacy policy

Thank you for your interest in our website. Below we inform you in detail about the handling of your data.

## 1. Access data and hosting 

You can visit our website without providing any personal information. Each time a website is called up, the web server merely automatically saves a so-called server log file which, for example, contains the name of the requested file, your IP address, date and time of the call, the amount of data transmitted and the requesting provider (access data) and documents the call.

These access data are evaluated exclusively for the purpose of ensuring trouble-free operation of the site and improving our services. This serves to protect our legitimate interests in a correct presentation of our offer, which predominate within the scope of a balancing of interests. All access data will be deleted no later than seven days after the end of your visit to the site.

### Third-party hosting services

As part of processing on our behalf, a third party provider provides us with hosting and website presentation services. This serves to protect our legitimate interests in a correct presentation of our offer, which predominate within the scope of a balancing of interests. All data collected in connection with the use of this website is processed on its servers. Processing on other servers only takes place in the framework described here.

This service provider is located within a country of the European Union.

## 2. Data collection and use for contract processing
   
We collect personal data when you provide it to us as part of an order or when contacting us, e.g. by e-mail. We use the data provided by you to process contracts and your enquiries. After complete processing of the contract, your data will be restricted for further processing and deleted after expiry of any retention periods under tax and commercial law, unless you have expressly consented to further use of your data or we reserve the right to use data beyond this, which is permitted by law and about which we inform you in this declaration.

## 3. Contact possibilities and your rights
   
You have a right to free information about your personal data stored by us and, if applicable, a right to correction, restriction of processing, data transferability or deletion of this data.

If you have any questions regarding the collection, processing or use of your personal data, information, correction, blocking or deletion of data or revocation of consent given or objection to a specific use of data, please contact us directly via the contact data in our legal notice.

In addition, you have a right of appeal to the competent data protection supervisory authority.

## 4. Right of objection
   
Insofar as we process personal data as described above in order to protect our legitimate interests, which predominate within the scope of a balance of interests, you can object to this processing with effect for the future. If the data is processed for direct marketing purposes, you can exercise this right at any time as described above. If the processing takes place for other purposes, you are only entitled to a right of objection if there are reasons arising from your particular situation.

After exercising your right of objection, we will not process your personal data further for these purposes, unless we can prove compelling reasons worthy of protection for the processing, which outweigh your interests, rights and freedoms, or if the processing serves to assert, exercise or defend legal claims.
