## The rotor

The VoiceOver Rotor (**VO-U**) feature helps users perform some common navigation actions quickly and easily. You can select
which item types to display in the Rotor by opening the VoiceOver utility with **VO-F8**, and then going to Web > Web Rotor.

Open the rotor by pressing **VO-U**, and then use the Left Arrow and Right Arrow keys to choose between the item types,
such as links, headings, tables, frames, images, form controls, landmarks, visited links and
non-visited links. Once a page element type is selected, use the **Up-** and **Down-Arrow** to select a specific element
and Enter to activate it. Use Escape to exit the rotor.

Within the rotor, you can start typing to filter the available elements. Example: With the Header rotor open, press "2"
to filter for second level headings.
