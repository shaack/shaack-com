# From planning to operation.

Our services cover the entire spectrum from planning and production to the operation of your app or website.

## Conception, planning and design

**Planning** is essential. The concept and the definition of the general conditions influence all your future interaction
with the website or app.

Complexity is the enemy of **security** and also the enemy of users and editors. Therefore we look for the simplest
system for the respective requirements.

A clear **structure** makes it easier to use. This is reflected in my design, the user interface of the app and the overall
concept of the website.

## Production

I draw on over 15 years of experience in developing apps and websites. What I program is tested and
meets the requirements. Related to the technique, I offer

- **full stack programming for web and apps** and
- **quality assurance and automated testing** of webapps, websites and webshops

## Operation and maintenance

In order for your website or app to **run stably**, the system needs to be updated regularly. Data loss can
can be counteracted with a **backup concept**. 

With a **maintenance contract** I can offer you a carefree flat rate for a functioning
server system that runs reliably and always has all important security updates installed.
